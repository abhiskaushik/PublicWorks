Overview
--------

This is an Android application which is going to be used for reviewing government facilities.
It will be used by volunteers to visit government facilities such as toilets & latrines ... 
and gather data that will be send to the government server for review.
This will be used to make sure the money being dispersed for these facilities are being used
for the correct purpose.
The fluid UI for the application is available [here][1].


Features
--------

we hope to implement the following features :

* The app will have a login facility for the volunteers, the user name and the hash of the entered password will be send to the server for authentication. This will take place asynchronously so that the user experience won't be affected.
In the server side after the hash corresponding to the user name is fetched from the database, it is compared with hash key which was sent and the result of the comparison is conveyed to the client (mobile app) which is used to take the 
user to the next activity.

* We also will have a 'stay logged in' option in the login activity letting the volunteer bypass this whole login process
after the first time. We can do this by storing the username and password hash in the app cache using shared preferences
and using them without user interference. This way if the password was changed the app will ask the user to login again.

* In the second activity we will use the GPS in the mobile to use the user's location to find the nearby locations 
and display it in a list. The user can choose from the locations in the list and answer some standard questions.
This will ensure that the volunteer was physically present at the location when he reviews the utility.

* Then in the final activity the user can choose existing pictures from the gallery or take them on the fly and send
a maximum of 4 images to the server.
