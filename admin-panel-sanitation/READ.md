Couldnt  create query based installation.
So 3 manual step installation are these:
INSTALLATION:
1.Go to /core/connect/database.php and put your database username and password
2.create a database called sanitation and import sanitation.sql
3.Go to members.php and enter you database username and password.

Open localhost/admin-panel-sanitation (y)

To generate vkeys you guys can write a function separately.
